# USED-Project
Here's what we achieved for the UDES renewable energies competition:

Our project, named Sustainable Station, is a charging station for electric cars that generates its own electricity using three renewable energy sources.

Key Technologies Employed:

- Computer Vision: Enables smart parking functionality.
- Python Programming: Developed a user-friendly app for smart parking management.
- Piezoelectricity: We utilized real piezoelectric plates with an Arduino board as sensors at the parking entrance and exit. Additionally, piezoelectric plates were incorporated into speed bumps on a larger road to generate electricity from traffic vibrations.
- SolidWorks & 3D Modeling: We designed a 3D model of a novel and innovative solar cooker that not only cooks but also generates electricity using a Stirling engine.

A Big Thank You:

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the scientific club team members for their unwavering dedication. This project is a testament to the countless hours invested in research and development, and it will serve as a lasting legacy for the 2024 scientific club team.
